The BAM Login device reads a code from a card, such as a student ID, using an RFID reader. This is then transmitted to an online accessible document which can be remotely viewed by anyone with access. This data is then used to keep track of who is in the meeting or lab, and additionally alerts officers if there is an unauthorized user in the meeting/lab. This can also be used for liability issues since a log is kept which keeps track of who enters the lab and when.
